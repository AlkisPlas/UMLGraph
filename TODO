Add in UmlGraphDoc support for showing package dependencies.
See http://java.dzone.com/articles/reverse-engineer-source-code-u#comment-6124

Add link to MoinMoin sequence to deriv.xml

Yves Bossel: If I may do some suggestions:
  + Self-adjusting box size and placement on sequence diagrams would help (I use lots of inner classes whose names are long and descriptive).

Try the http://prefuse.sourceforge.net/ back end for large graphs.

Provide a parameter to say how (untagged) data members relate to other
classes.
The line can be a composition, an aggregation, or a navigable association.
public class A  {
      .....
  }

  public class B  {
      A myInstance;
  }
Requires special care for containers and arrays.

Support for all UML diagrams: state, use-case, etc.

command-line (and global) options for setting all graph attributes

Class options for setting edge attributes fillcolor fontcolor etc per edge

Use doclet error reporting functions

A class can specify its rank, or its cluster.

The dot edge routing is not the best possible for UML.  Implement a rectangular routing strategy, maybe based on stochastic optimization using simulated annealing.
