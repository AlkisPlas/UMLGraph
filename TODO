Yves Bossel: If I may do some suggestions:
  + I would appreciate to be able to add UML comments to both diagram types.
  + Adding patterns (collaborations ellipse with roles bound to classes) would be welcome into class diagrams.
  + Self-adjusting box size and placement on sequence diagrams would help (I use lots of inner classes whose names are long and descriptive).


Try the http://prefuse.sourceforge.net/ back end for large graphs.

Provide a parameter to say how (untagged) data members relate to other
classes.
The line can be a composition, an aggregation, or a navigable association.
public class A  {
      .....
  }

  public class B  {
      A myInstance;
  }
Requires special care for containers and arrays.

Add package, note, interface and node icons to graphviz
    (folder) dog-ear =[]         3D box

Support for all UML diagrams: state, use-case, etc.

command-line (and global) options for setting all graph attributes

Class options for setting edge attributes fillcolor fontcolor etc per edge

@active tag to render a class as active

Use doclet error reporting functions

A class can specify its rank, or its cluster.

The dot edge routing is not the best possible for UML.  Implement a rectangular routing strategy, maybe based on stochastic optimization using simulated annealing.
