Let us try to improve the simple sequence diagram.
<fmtcode ext="pic">
# Object definition
object(S,"s:Switch");
object(P,"p:Pump");
step();
active(S);
active(P);

# Message exchange
message(S,P,"run()");
message(S,P,"stop()");

# Object lifeline completion
step();
complete(S);
complete(P);
</fmtcode>
Here, we have manually advanced the timeline of our diagrams
with a <code>step();</code> call after we defined the objects,
to provide them with a bit of breathing space.
We also added a similar step call at the end of the diagram.
Finally, we made both objects active, after their definition.
Calling active on a given object will change the drawing of its
lifeline, from the dashed format indicating an inactive object,
to a thick swimming-lane, active object, format.

The resultant diagram is<br />
