To install UmlGraph follow these steps.
<ol>
<li> Copy the files in <code>lib</code> to a directory you will
use for storing UmlGraph's installation
(for instance, <code>/usr/local/lib</code>).
</li>
<li> Copy the file <code>bin/umlgraph</code> (for Unix) or
<code>bin/umlgraph.bat</code> (for Windows) to a directory
of your execution path (for instance, <code>/usr/local/bin</code>).</li>
<li> Adjust the above file, setting <code>UMLGRAPH_HOME</code> to
point to the directory where you installed the UmlGraph library files.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
UMLGraph is implemented as a <em>javadoc</em> doclet (a program satisfying the
doclet API that specifies the content and format of the output
generated by the <em>javadoc</em> tool).
Furthermore, the output of UmlGraph needs to be post-processed
with the <em>Graphviz</em> <em>dot</em> program.
Therefore, to draw class diagrams with UmlGraph class you will need to have
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/"><em>javadoc</em></a>
and
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>
installed on your computer.
Both programs are freely available, from Sun and AT&amp;T respectively,
for many platforms including Unix and Windows.
<em>Javadoc</em> is part of the Sun JDK, so a typical JDK installation will also
include <em>javadoc</em>.

<p>
To draw UML sequence diagrams you must also install the free
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html">GNU plotutils</a>
system.
